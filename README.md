This repo contains the python solution files for all the leetcode/other coding problems I have solved.

Ik its not many but hey we all gotta start somewhere :)

`test.ipynb` is used for debugging code and or working out solutions before writing the actual ones 

PS - The files with names preceded by # are not leetcode problems, they're either from GFG or from somewhere else

Peace x
